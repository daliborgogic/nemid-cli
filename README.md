# nemid-cli

> A list of already created NemID til Private (POCES) test users.

How to generate your own test user:
- Issuance of test users must be done from [https://appletk.danid.dk/developers/](https://appletk.danid.dk/developers/) (whitelisting required):
- If you are an E-Ident customer, send your IP address and MID to Nets using the [Contact us](https://www.nets.eu/developer/e-ident/contactus) form. We will forward the request to NemID. For others, see NemID [Adgang til testsystem](https://www.nets.eu/dk-da/kundeservice/nemid-tjenesteudbyder/implementering/Pages/adgang-til-testsystem.aspx).
- No detailed guide for issuance of POCES test user exists. When creating a test user, please make sure to select a valid password (6 or more characters, and at least one character and one number).

> If you select an invalid password, any attempt to test with this user will generate a `SRV004` error.
